As air pollution is a complex mixture of toxic components with considerable impact on 
humans, forecasting air pollution concentration emerges as a priority for improving life 
quality. The research activity described in this paper concerns the study of the 
phenomena responsible for the urban and suburban air pollution. In this study, air quality 
data (observational and numerical) were used to produce daily average spot concentration forecasts of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), for two stations across Delhi â€“ Shadipur and NSIT, Dwaraka. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that has a diameter 
of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. The study 
analyzed the air-pollution principal causes and identified the best subset of features 
(meteorological data and air pollutants concentrations) for PM2.5 in order to predict its 
concentration. Overall, this study has demonstrated the potential application value of 
systematically collecting and analyzing datasets using machine learning techniques for 
the prediction of submicron sized ambient air pollutants. Various forecast models for 
PM2.5 were built using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine algorithm, Multi
layer perceptron neural networks (MLP NN) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) 
algorithm. The XGBoost method is also compared with the random forest algorithm, 
linear regression, decision tree algorithm and support vector machines using 
computational results. The results demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm outperforms 
other methods.
